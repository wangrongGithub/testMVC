Project description:

This project uses the adjacency matrix and the adjacency list to store the graph in the Project 5 and implements breadth-first traversal and depth-first traversal based on the two storage structures.



Project running method:

Create a java project in Ecplise, delete the original src folder in the project, and copy the src folder I provided into the project. Then click on the Main.java file to run the program, and the traversal results will be output in the console.
